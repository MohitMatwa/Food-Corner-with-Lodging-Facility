The code begins with the input of amounts for many different objects, including rooms, where the user must specify the number of rooms and the quantities of items that are available. The user is prompted to input his choice of the things he wishes to order after providing this information in the code. If the user orders more than the number of products that are available, "Not available" will be displayed. The user can order items up to the amount that is available. When the user's order has been fulfilled press 7 to exit the code.
